    that is clean, elegant, and fun. The nav element has a class attribute and contains an unordered list of three key sections for the
    portfolio. Each section in the unordered list has a hypertext anchor. When the user clicks on any of these nav sections, then the user
    is directly taken to that specific part of the page.-->

        to generate them. But I'm not there yet. Oh well. Also, I made a custom placeholder image to use for the six projects I made up.-->
