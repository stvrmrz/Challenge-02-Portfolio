<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Example Webpage

![Project Example Web Page](/assets/images/02-advanced-css-homework-demo.gif)


This project was designed to teach us about building and structuring a professional portfolio. Utilization of advanced css like media queries, and flexbox, I was able to build my webpage from scratch. My approach was to keep the look of the design simple and clearn and scalable as more and more project get completed.

Here's why we're doing this:
* Putting to use advanced techniques with CSS
* Once again, great refresher on version control, Git, and GitHub
* Showcase the importance of clean and up to date portfolio.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- [x] WHEN I load their portfolio
      THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- [x] WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
      THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- [x] WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
      THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- [x] WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
      THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- [x] WHEN I click on the images of the applications
      THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- [x] WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
      THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
