<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Example Webpage

![Project Example Web Page](/assets/images/02-advanced-css-homework-demo.gif)


This project was designed to teach us about building and structuring a professional portfolio. Utilization of advanced css like media queries, and flexbox, I was able to build my webpage from scratch. My approach was to keep the look of the design simple and clearn and scalable as more and more project get completed.

Here's why we're doing this:
* Putting to use advanced techniques with CSS
* Once again, great refresher on version control, Git, and GitHub
* Showcase the importance of accessbility ðŸ˜€

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] When I view the source code, then I find semantic HTML elements
- [x] When I view the structure of the HTML elements, then I find that elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- [x] When I view the icon and image elements, then I find accessible alt attributes
- [x] When I view the heading attributes, then they fall in sequential order
- [x] When I view the title element, then I find a concise descriptive title

See the [closed issues](https://github.com/stvrmrz/Challenge-01-Refactor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for a full list of features.
